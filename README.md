This repo is a work in progress. There may be foundational structural changes in the future.

## Organization:
- [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/davis-matthew/Billy-Hatcher-Modding/wiki) document tutorials on how to use the tools and perform the parts of modding billy that we've been able to reverse engineer.
- Tools currently contains helper scripts that admittedly do not have documentation on their usage, and may have been altered to be in a broken state, but may be helpful. They are utilities used during the reverse engineering that I am uploading to the repo for bookkeeping. I intend to add more refined tools here which aid the actual modding process more.


## Misc Notes:
Blender:
- Blender -> scripting -> new -> paste in objects.py
- shift right click + n to see location

Billy Debug:
- escape -> no fall for fly mode
- shift -> up, cntrl -> down

## Potential Future Efforts:
- Display character bounding box at the current blender 3d cursor location?
- Display objects of the set obj models in blender
- Mod Resource Packing / Loading
